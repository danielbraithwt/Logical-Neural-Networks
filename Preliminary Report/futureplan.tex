\chapter{Future Plan}\label{C:futureplan}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Investigate why the DNF network learns better than CNF in some occasions and visa versa. \textbf{2 Weeks}
\item Compare performance and interpretability on some benchmark problems which have boolean inputs. \textbf{2 Days}
\item Investigate applying LNF Networks to problems with continuous inputs, will the inputs be discretized? \textbf{2 Weeks}
\item Compare against other rule extraction methods, using criteria laid out in \cite{andrews1995survey}. This would include  and investigate the generalization of the extracted rules as the training set is reduced. It has been shown that LNF Networks are able to generalize \textbf{4 Weeks}
\end{enumerate}

This plan accounts for other work during semester 2, and for writing the final report as work is done. The aims is to have the work finished before the final report submission to allow a couple of weeks to focus on just the final report writing.
