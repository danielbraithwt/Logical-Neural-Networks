\chapter{Future Plan}\label{C:futureplan}

\begin{enumerate}
\item Investigate why the DNF network learns better than CNF in some ocations and visa versa. \textbf{2 Weeks}
\item Compare performance and intepretability on some benchmark problems which have boolean inputs. \textbf{2 Weeks}
\item Investigate applying LNF Networks to problems with continuous inputs, will the inputs be descretized? \textbf{4 Weeks}
\item Compare against other rule extraction methods, using criteria laid out in \cite{andrews1995survey}. This would include  and investigate the generalization of the extracted rules as the training set is reduced. It has been shown that LNF Networks are able to generalize \textbf{4 Weeks}
\end{enumerate}

This plan accounts for other work during semester 2, and aims to have the work finished before the final report submission to allow a couple of weeks for final report writing.
