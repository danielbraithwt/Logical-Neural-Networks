\chapter{Request For Feedback}\label{C:requestforfeedback}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Is the methodology used to test and compare performances reasonable? What would be some ways to improve it?
	\item Currently performance has only been tested up to a size of 9, what would be a more reasonable number to better demonstrate the capabilities of the networks?
	\item What would be considered a good way of showing the promise (or lack there of) of the concepts presented in the report?
	\item Is there anything that you think should be investigated which is missing from the future plan.
