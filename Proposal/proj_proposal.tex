\begin{abstract}
Neural networks have been shown to be universal function approximators  and have been employeed to solve a number of non-trivial problems. The downside to these networks is that they are very diffcult (if not impossible) to understand. We aim to build on previous research showing that Logical Neural Networks applyed to the MINST dataset showing comparable peformance to standard NN's and a more understandlbe network by formally proving a foundation for LLN's, investigating where LLN's are best applyed and whether we can approximate our LLN as a descrete logic circut.

\section*{1. Introduction}

Neural Networks (NN's) peform exceptionally well over a wide range of different problems. However once trained these networks become a black box, near impossible for a human to understand what features the network is using to solve the problem presented to it. Logical Neural Networks (LLN's), that is NN's with logic based activation functions, have previously [REFERENCE PREV HONORS PROJECT] been shown to provide a more understandable representation while still peforming well (in the context of the MINST dataset). Despite the promise of LLN's not alot investigation into them has occoured.

\section*{2. The Problem}

The problem with standard NN's is that once trained they are very diffcult (if not impossible) for a human to understand. Previously LLN's have been shown to have promise as an alternative to standard NN's with the added benifit of having sparse weights and being easier to understand. We suggest this problem still hasnt been completly solved as we have yet to develop a rigourous and formal foundation for LLN's. First we ask, can it be proven that like standard NN's, LLN's are also universal function approximators?  Before we can hope to answer this key question we also must ask whether we have the right paramaterisation of noisy gates as these form the foundation of an LLN. \\

Regardless of our answer to the first question a next logical step for our investigation is to ask, what types of problems is an LLN best suited to? Which ones can it not only peform well on but also provide a useful learned representation. This will help build the foundation of LLN's, giving us a better understnading of how to configure LLN's for diffrenrent problems, i.e. network layout and which logical neurons to use.

Finally we pose a concept which LLN's seem uniquicly quallified to solve given they are based of logic gates. Being able to create hardware NN's would be increadibley powerful (as hardware is alot faster). There dosnt seem to be any intuative way to achieve this with standard NN's but approximating the continous logic gates in our LLN as descrete ones would make it possible. But is it possible to create an approximation in a feasable way without sacrifacing to much accuracy?

\section*{3. Proposed Solution}

Research done previously into LLN's has shown that using a network with layers consisting of Noisy-OR and Noisy-And neurons can achieve a reasonable accuracy on the MINST dataset while also providing a more understandable network. To begin this project we take a step back to ensure we have the right approach. A network built out of neurons that resembel logic gates we would expect should be able to learn any given boolean formula. This would show we have good paramaterisations for our noisy gates and be a fundimental step towards proving LLN's are universal function approximators. First we must address a fundimental issue with our existing setup, namely our choice of "gates" is not a functionally complete set. Consider the issue of representing some know boolean expression using descrete logic, but we only have access to AND and OR gates, AND combined with OR is not functionally complete. We propose to implement a number of differet sets of functionally complete nurons, such as NAND and NOR. These logical neurons would be paramaterised so we can observer the same nice propertys we see with descrete gates, i.e. NOT(AND) = NAND. If an LLN consisted of multiple layers of NAND's or NOR's we would expect to find groups of gates learning to act like some of our other gates. \\

The first 4 weeks of this project would be taken to fully understand the concept of Noisy gates, using the biblyography of the previous research along with other reasources. Along with developing our paramaterisation of logical gates. The gates we aim to paramaterise and implement are AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR. \\

Our choice of gates have paramaterisations which matain convenient propertys and are functionally complete, so intuatively we would expect our LLN to be able to learn any known boolean function, the results here will be interesting as we might find that theroetcally our LLN can approximate any boolean function but in practice some can not be learnt so easily. As part of experements with learning boolean functions it would be interesting to experement with the training data given to the network, how can we train a network which generalises well. Say we trainied a network with one of the boolean inputs fixed at 0, then would the network be able to generalise to the case where that input is 1? We expect to spend 6 weeks investigating at the conclusion of which we aim to have a proof demontrainting that LLN's can approximate any know boolean function along with strong evidence showing which collections of neurons work well together, give the most understanble trained network and in what configuration yeields the best results. \\

Next we address a fundimental question, are LLN's universal function approximators? Working towards a proof or strong evidence showing this in ether direction we can start by experementing with an LLN learning some general functions and comparing its peformance to a standard NN. These experements are not equivelnt to a proof but will reveal which direction we should persue. At the conculsion of this part we expect to have strong justification for answering this question, we allocate 6 weeks for this section. \\

Now that we have explored the foundation of LLN's, using this knowledge we want to use our LLN to solve standard benchmark problems and compare agains peformance of standard NN's. We would use K-Fold Cross Validation, which is commonly used for comparasons like this. It would then be useful to examine the trained LLN and see if we can understand how the network has learned to represent the problem as this really is the motivation behind LLN's. We allocate 4 weeks for this. \\

We have esentially constructed NN's out of neurons which resemble continous logic gates, something to explore is can we feasabley approxamate these continous gates with descrete ones as this would esentially allow us to create hardware NN's. Peforming such a task would centianly require more gates than neurons but would this blowup result in something that could feasibly be printed on a circut board. We allocate any remaining time to investigating this problem and developing/implementing methods to solve it.\\

An overview of the proposed solution folows
\begin{itemize}
\item Produce bibliography and paramaterisation of gates (est: 4 weeks)
\item Proving LLN's can/can not approximate any known boolean function (est: 6 weeks)
\item Proving LLN's are/are not universal function approximators (est: 6 weeks)
\item Evaluate LLN's on benchmark problems (est: 4 weeks)
\item Explore approximating LLN as descrete logic circut (est: remaining time)
\end{itemize}

\section*{4. Evaluating your Solution}

A solution to this problem should build the foundation to LLN's. Giving a proof that LLN's can approximate any known boolean function and strong evidence/proof showing that LLN's are universal function approximators. This would require an indepth investigation into various paramaterisations of logic gates. Folowing this it should identify where LLN's are most powerful and where a standard NN should be used insted. Finally a study investigating approximating an LLN as a descrete logic circut.
