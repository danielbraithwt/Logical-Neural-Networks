\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\thispagestyle{empty}
I would particularly like to thank Marcus Frean; this report would not have been possible without his constant support, encouragement, and knowledge. I could not have asked for a more helpful supervisor.\\

I would also like to express my gratitude towards my parents, Anna Debnam and Eric Braithwaite, without their unwavering financial and spiritual support I would not be in a position to be at university or peruse research.\\

Thank you to my partner Scarlett Aroha O'Callaghan for supporting me through this and putting up with all the late nights and absent weekends.\\

Last but not least thank you to everyone I have gotten to know and work alongside in the Honors Labs, it has been a pleasure.\\
