I would particularly like to thank Marcus Frean; this report would not have been possible without his constant support, encouragement, and knowledge. I could not have asked for a more helpful supervisor.\\

I would also like to express my gratitude towards my parents, Anna Debnam and Eric Braithwaite, without their unwavering financial and spiritual support I would not be in a position to peruse research.
