\begin{abstract}
Artificial Neural Networks are growing in popularity and can generalize well to unseen examples. However, it can be difficult to interpret the learned models; a problem which is driving the development of systems that are not only accurate but have a decision-making process that can be defended. This report develops a novel neural network architecture which builds in an interpretable structure. Experiments on the MNIST dataset showed these models had a statistically equivalent performance to Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks and provided evidence that they have a more interpretable learned model. The networks developed here were also shown to perform well when compared with recently developed methods aimed at solving the same problem.
