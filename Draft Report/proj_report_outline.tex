\begin{abstract}

The growing popularity of Artificial Neural Networks is driving the development of systems that are not only accurate but have a decision making process that can be defended. The report develops a novel neural network architecture which builds in an interpretable structure. Experiments on the MNIST dataset showed these models have statistically equivalent performance to Multi Layer Perceptron Networks with a more interpretable learned model.
