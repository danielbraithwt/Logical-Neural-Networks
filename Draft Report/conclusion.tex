\chapter{Conclusion}\label{C:con}


The growing number of situations where Artifical Neural Networks (ANNs) are used is driving the development of intepretable models. Being able to defend an ANNs decision can protect users from un safe or ethically biased systems and protect companies utilizing such sysems from breaching EU regulations.\\

This report derived modifications for the LNN structure giving them stistically equivelent peformance to standard Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks and improving the intepretability of the leant models. By obesrving the weights of LNNs trainined over the MNIST data set it was possible to determin what input features contributed to each classification and verify that the logic learnt was "sensible".\\

Logical Neural Networks where then applied to Auto Encoders, while the peformance of Logical Auto Encoders was worse than standard Sigmoid Auto Encoders it demonstraits the flexability of LNNs and the range of situations where they can be applied.\\

LNNs have limitations, prehapse the biggest comes down to intepreting multi layer logical neural networks. It is possible to directly extract the influence each input feature has on the ouputs in LNNs with no hidden layers. Hidden layers introduce dependencies between input features making it diffcult to find a direct influence of inputs on the outputs. Because of this limitation any future work which can develop better ways to intepret these models would increase the power of LNNs.
